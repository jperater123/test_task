    <h1 class="text-center">About Solepower</h1>

    <div class="about-section">
        <p>Solepower was created to make it easier for Australian players to understand the always-changing world of online casinos. There’s plenty of distractions and misinformation out there—big promotions with high wagering requirements, complicated terms and conditions, and sites that look slick but don’t always live up to the hype. We cut through all that noise and give you clear, honest guidance so you can choose where to play with confidence and safety.</p>
        <p>If you ever spot something that doesn’t quite add up, want our take on a particular casino, or just feel like asking a question, you can reach us anytime at <strong>[email protected]</strong>. We are always happy to hear from fellow Aussie punters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our goal is simple: help Australian punters find online casinos that are quick, fair, and genuinely worth your time. Online gambling is only enjoyable when the payouts are fast, the rules are clear, and the games are fair.</p>
        <p>At Solepower, we:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compare casinos based on withdrawal speeds, fairness, game variety, usability, and bonus value.</li>
            <li>Break down complex topics—wagering requirements, payout times, mobile optimisation, crypto options—into plain English.</li>
            <li>Point out perks and pitfalls, from slow support teams to restrictive bonus terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We don’t take shortcuts or push casinos simply because they look attractive. Every review is based on research, real testing where possible, and criteria centered on the Australian player experience.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>How Solepower Started</h2>
        <p>Solepower began because accurate, no-nonsense online casino information was surprisingly hard to find. Too many so-called "reviews" were really advertisements — giving players the illusion of advice without the honesty behind it.</p>
        <p>Our small team of casino enthusiasts, researchers, and long-time bettors decided to build something better: a place where you can quickly see which casinos pay out fast, have clear T&Cs, and treat players with respect.</p>
        <p>We dig into licensing, test platforms, listen to real user experiences, and always spell out the fine print. If a casino looks impressive but doesn’t hold up in practice, we say so plainly — honesty is the entire point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
        <h3>No Casino Can Buy a Top Spot</h3>
        <p>We never sell rankings or allow casinos to pay for better reviews. If we use affiliate links, they are disclosed — and they never influence what we recommend.</p>
        
        <h3>Real People, Real Expertise</h3>
        <p>Every guide, comparison, and review is written by people who actually understand online gambling. We know the frustration of delayed payouts, confusing bonus terms, and unfair rules.</p>
        <p>We update our content regularly so you’re always getting fresh, accurate insights — not last year’s recycled advice.</p>
        
        <h3>A Player-First Approach</h3>
        <p>Before recommending any casino, we always ask: “Would this be a good experience for an Aussie player?”</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast cash-outs and trustworthy support</li>
            <li>Fair gameplay and transparent rules</li>
            <li>Clear explanation of withdrawal limits, bonus traps, and hidden terms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a casino seems more trouble than it’s worth, we say so — plainly and honestly.</p>
        
        <h3>Your Privacy Matters</h3>
        <p>Many players want to browse quietly without giving away personal data. At Solepower:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No account required to use the site</li>
            <li>We do not sell your data — ever</li>
            <li>Any analytics used are anonymous and for improving the site only</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also promote responsible gambling: setting limits, taking breaks, and knowing when to stop. Your safety matters more than any casino feature.</p>
        <p>Solepower exists to help Australians make informed, confident decisions in a fast-moving online casino landscape. Whether you're new to online gaming or a long-time punter seeking better options, we’re here to guide you — straightforward, unbiased, and always on your side.</p>
